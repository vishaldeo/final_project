# FINAL PROJECT

## Team Members: Vishal Singh, Manpreet Kaur, Michelle Carranza and John Lansberry

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### In many popular sunbelt retirement communities rent has risen by more than 30 % over the past year.  This surge will have economic impacts on many people, especially retirees who are on a fixed income.

### The objective of our project is to predict what rental rates will look like in 10 years and equate that to the predicted increases in social security in the same timeframe.
